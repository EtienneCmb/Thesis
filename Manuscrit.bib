  abstract = {Recurrent chromosomal alterations provide cytological and molecular positions for the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer. Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) has been useful in understanding these alterations in cancerous cells. CGH datasets consist of samples that are represented by large dimensional arrays of intervals. Each sample consists of long runs of intervals with losses and gains.
In this article, we develop novel SVM-based methods for classification and feature selection of CGH data. For classification, we developed a novel similarity kernel that is shown to be more effective than the standard linear kernel used in SVM. For feature selection, we propose a novel method based on the new kernel that iteratively selects features that provides the maximum benefit for classification. We compared our methods against the best wrapper-based and filter-based approaches that have been used for feature selection of large dimensional biological data. Our results on datasets generated from the Progenetix database, suggests that our methods are considerably superior to existing methods.

As a case study we evaluate six machine learning algorithms (C4.5, Multiscale Classifier, Perceptron, Multi-layer Perceptron, k-Nearest Neighbours, and a Quadratic Discriminant Function) on six ``real world'' medical diagnostics data sets. We compare and discuss the use of AUC to the more conventional overall accuracy and find that AUC exhibits a number of desirable properties when compared to overall accuracy: increased sensitivity in Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) tests; a standard error that decreased as both AUC and the number of test samples increased; decision threshold independent; and it is invariant to a priori class probabilities. The paper concludes with the recommendation that AUC be used in preference to overall accuracy for ``single number'' evaluation of machine learning algorithms.},

  abstract = {Electrocorticography of the primary motor cortex (M1) is a promising tool for controlling a brain\textendash{}computer interface (BCI). Electrocorticograms (ECoG) of the human M1 within the central sulcus (intrasulcal ECoG) have been rarely examined. In order to evaluate the usefulness of intrasulcal ECoG for BCI, we examined patients with subdural electrodes placed temporarily inside the central sulcus and over the sensorimotor cortex (gyral ECoG). Five patients were asked to perform or imagine two or three classes of simple upper limb movements. Univariate statistical analysis of the results revealed that the intrasulcal ECoG on M1 showed significant variability across movement classes. A support vector machine was used for classification of single-trial ECoG signals to infer movement class (neural decoding). The movement classes were predicted with 80\textendash{}90\% accuracy (chance level: 33\% or 50\%). To reveal the relative importance of anatomical areas for neural decoding, the decoding performance was compared between gyral and intrasulcal ECoGs. The intrasulcal ECoG on the motor bank showed higher performance than the equally-sized gyral ECoG or the intrasulcal ECoG on the sensory bank. Analysis using a short time window revealed that movement class could be decoded even before movement onset. These results suggest the usefulness of intrasulcal ECoG on M1 to infer upper limb movements and present a promising application for a practical BCI system.},

  abstract = {The ability to use electrophysiological brain signals to decode various parameters of voluntary movement is a central question in Brain Machine Interface (BMI) research. Invasive BMI systems can successfully decode movement trajectories from the spiking activity of neurons in primary motor cortex and posterior parietal cortex. It has long been assumed that non-invasive techniques do not provide sufficient signal resolution to decode the kinematics of complex time-varying movements. This view stems from the hypothesis that movement parameters such as direction, position, velocity, or acceleration are primarily encoded by neuronal firing in motor cortex. Consequently, the fact that such signals cannot be detected using non-invasive techniques such as Electroencephalography (EEG) or Magnetoencephalography (MEG) has led to the claim that fine movement properties cannot be decoded with non-invasive methods. However, this view has been proven wrong by numerous studies in recent years. First, a growing body of research over the last decade has shown that the local field potential (LFP) signal, which represents the summed activity of a neuronal population, can encode movement parameters at a level comparable to unit recordings. These findings were confirmed in humans by the successful use of electrocorticography (ECoG) to achieve continuous movement decoding via invasive human BMI approaches. Very recently, a number of non-invasive studies were able to provide striking evidence that even surface-level MEG or EEG data can contain sufficient information on hand movement in order to infer movement direction and hand kinematics from brain signals recorded using non-invasive methods. Here we provide a brief review of this recent literature and discuss its importance on the future of BMI research and its implications on the development of novel motor rehabilitation strategies.},

This is done by defining a purely invertible discrete transform, representing a signal either in the time or in the time-frequency domain, as simply as possible with the conventional discrete Fourier transform between the time and the frequency domains. The wavelet concept has been used to build this transform. To get a correct invertibility of this procedure, the authors have proposed orthogonal and periodic basic discrete wavelets. The properties of such a transform are described, and examples on brain-evoked potential signals are given to illustrate the time-frequency filtering possibilities.},

  abstract = {Electrocorticographic (ECoG) signals have been successfully used to provide information about arm movement direction, individual finger movements and even continuous arm movement trajectories. Thus, ECoG has been proposed as a potential control signal for implantable brain\textendash{}machine interfaces (BMIs) in paralyzed patients. For the neuronal control of a prosthesis with versatile hand/arm functions, it is also necessary to successfully decode different types of grasping movements, such as precision grip and whole-hand grip. Although grasping is one of the most frequent and important hand movements performed in everyday life, until now, the decoding of ECoG activity related to different grasp types has not been systematically investigated. Here, we show that two different grasp types (precision vs. whole-hand grip) can be reliably distinguished in natural reach-to-grasp movements in single-trial ECoG recordings from the human motor cortex. Self-paced movement execution in a paradigm accounting for variability in grasped object position and weight was chosen to create a situation similar to everyday settings. We identified three informative signal components (low-pass-filtered component, low-frequency and high-frequency amplitude modulations), which allowed for accurate decoding of precision and whole-hand grips. Importantly, grasp type decoding generalized over different object positions and weights. Within the frontal lobe, informative signals predominated in the precentral motor cortex and could also be found in the right hemisphere's homologue of Broca's area. We conclude that ECoG signals are promising candidates for BMIs that include the restoration of grasping movements. Highlights \ensuremath{\blackpointerright} Two modes of natural grasping can be reliably discriminated from human ECoG. \ensuremath{\blackpointerright} The decoding of grasp types generalizes over different object positions and weights. \ensuremath{\blackpointerright} A low-frequency component and high-frequency amplitudes yield best decoding. \ensuremath{\blackpointerright} ECoG may be used in BMIs for the restoration of grasping movements.},

  abstract = {Les Interfaces Cerveau-Machine sont des dispositifs permettant d'instaurer un canal de communication entre le cerveau humain et le monde ext{\'e}rieur sans utiliser les voies usuelles nerveuses et musculaires. Le d{\'e}veloppement de tels syst{\`e}mes se situe {\`a} l'interface entre le traitement du signal, l'apprentissage statistique et la neurophysiologie. Dans cette th{\`e}se, nous avons r{\'e}alis{\'e} et {\'e}tudi{\'e} un dispositif d'Interface Cerveau-Machine non invasif asynchrone, c'est-{\`a}-dire capable d'identifier des actions mentales associ{\'e}es {\`a} des t{\^a}ches motrices ou cognitives imagin{\'e}es sans synchronisation sur un {\'e}v{\'e}nement contr{\^o}l{\'e} par un syst{\`e}me externe. Celui-ci est bas{\'e} sur l'analyse en temps r{\'e}el de signaux {\'e}lectro-enc{\'e}phalographiques (EEG) issus d'{\'e}lectrodes dispos{\'e}es {\`a} la surface de la t{\^e}te d'un sujet humain. Du point de vue m{\'e}thodologique, nous avons impl{\'e}ment{\'e} plusieurs techniques de pr{\'e}traitement de ces signaux et compar{\'e} leur influence sur les performances du syst{\`e}me. Ces techniques comprennent : 1) l'utilisation directe du signal issu des capteurs EEG, 2) l'exploitation de m{\'e}thodes de s{\'e}paration de sources qui permettent de r{\'e}sumer les signaux EEG par un faible nombre de composantes spatiales et 3) la reconstruction de l'activit{\'e} des sources de courant corticales par r{\'e}solution du probl{\`e}me inverse en EEG. De plus, plusieurs mesures permettant de quantifier l'activit{\'e} c{\'e}r{\'e}brale sont exploit{\'e}es et compar{\'e}es : la puissance spectrale, la coh{\'e}rence et la synchronie de phase. Nos r{\'e}sultats montrent que la reconstruction pr{\'e}alable de l'activit{\'e} corticale par probl{\`e}me inverse, ainsi que l'utilisation de mesures d'interaction {\`a} distance permettent d'am{\'e}liorer les performances du dispositif.},

However, because of the deluge of multichannel data generated by these experiments, achieving the full potential of parallel neuronal recordings depends on the development of new data mining techniques to extract meaningful information relating to time, frequency and space. Here, we aim to bridge this gap by focusing on up-to-date recording techniques for measurement of HFO and new analysis tools for their quantitative assessment. In particular, we emphasize how these methods can be applied, what property might be inferred from neuronal signals, and potentially productive future directions.},

  abstract = {The ability to monitor our own errors is mediated by a network that includes dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) and anterior insula (AI). However, the dynamics of the underlying neurophysiological processes remain unclear. In particular, whether AI is on the receiving or driving end of the error-monitoring network is unresolved. Here, we recorded intracerebral electroencephalography signals simultaneously from AI and dmPFC in epileptic patients while they performed a stop-signal task. We found that errors selectively modulated broadband neural activity in human AI. Granger causality estimates revealed that errors were immediately followed by a feedforward influence from AI onto anterior cingulate cortex and, subsequently, onto presupplementary motor area. The reverse pattern of information flow was observed on correct responses. Our findings provide the first direct electrophysiological evidence indicating that the anterior insula rapidly detects and conveys error signals to dmPFC, while the latter might use this input to adapt behavior following inappropriate actions.},

Despite its potential relevance for understanding healthy and pathological brain function, the standard CFC analysis and physiological interpretation come with fundamental problems. For example, apparent CFC can appear because of spectral correlations due to common non-stationarities that may arise in the total absence of interactions between neural frequency components. To provide a road map towards an improved mechanistic understanding of CFC, we organize the available and potential novel statistical/modeling approaches according to their biophysical interpretability. While we do not provide solutions for all the problems described, we provide a list of practical recommendations to avoid common errors and to enhance the interpretability of CFC analysis.},

The basic assumptions are that memory related oscillations are probably confined to theta and upper alpha and that other frequencies particularly in the gamma range are important for memory primarily because they become coupled to lower frequencies and/or because they play a specific role for a high precision timing of neural events (including phenomena such as LTP or LTD). In contrast to previous studies, where we related theta and upper alpha to a variety of different memory processes, we suggest here that these oscillations are associated with top-down control processes in two large storage systems, working memory (WM) and long-term memory (LTM). These systems may have their own types of top-down processes that control access to and/or manipulation of stored information. The hypothesis, suggested here is that theta and upper alpha reflect these processes which can be best studied when analyzing phase.},

  abstract = {Background
Sleep staging is a critical step in a range of electrophysiological signal processing pipelines used in clinical routine as well as in sleep research. Although the results currently achievable with automatic sleep staging methods are promising, there is need for improvement, especially given the time-consuming and tedious nature of visual sleep scoring.
New method
Here we propose a sleep staging framework that consists of a multi-class support vector machine (SVM) classification based on a decision tree approach. The performance of the method was evaluated using polysomnographic data from 15 subjects (electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculogram (EOG) and electromyogram (EMG) recordings). The decision tree, or dendrogram, was obtained using a hierarchical clustering technique and a wide range of time and frequency-domain features were extracted. Feature selection was carried out using forward sequential selection and classification was evaluated using k-fold cross-validation.
Results
The dendrogram-based SVM (DSVM) achieved mean specificity, sensitivity and overall accuracy of 0.92, 0.74 and 0.88 respectively, compared to expert visual scoring. Restricting DSVM classification to data where both experts' scoring was consistent (76.73\% of the data) led to a mean specificity, sensitivity and overall accuracy of 0.94, 0.82 and 0.92 respectively.
Comparison with existing methods
The DSVM framework outperforms classification with more standard multi-class ``one-against-all'' SVM and linear-discriminant analysis.
Conclusion
The promising results of the proposed methodology suggest that it may be a valuable alternative to existing automatic methods and that it could accelerate visual scoring by providing a robust starting hypnogram that can be further fine-tuned by expert inspection.},

  title = {A {{Brain Controlled Wheelchair}} to {{Navigate}} in {{Familiar Environments}}},
  abstract = {The Brain Controlled Wheelchair (BCW) is a simple robotic system designed for people, such as locked-in people, who are not able to use physical interfaces like joysticks or buttons. Our goal is to develop a system usable in hospitals and homes with minimal infrastructure modifications, which can help these people regain some mobility. The main challenge is to provide continuous and precise 2D control of the wheelchair from a Brain Computer Interface, which is typically characterized by a a very low information transfer rate. Besides, as design constraints, we want our BCW to be safe, ergonomic and relatively low cost. The strategy we propose relies on 1) constraining the motion of the wheelchair along predefined guiding paths, and 2) a slow but accurate P300 EEG brain interface to select the destination in a menu. This strategy reduces control to the selection of the appropriate destination, thus requires little concentration effort from the user. Besides, the trajectory is predictable, which contributes to reduce stress, and eliminates frustration that may be associated with trajectories generated by an artificial agent. Two fast BCIs are proposed to allow stopping the wheelchair while in motion. A hybrid BCI was developed to combine the slow P300 BCI used for destination selection with a faster modality to stop the wheelchair while in motion. Experiments with healthy users were conducted to evaluate performances of the BCIs. We found that after a short calibration phase, the destination selection BCI allowed the choice of a destination within 15 seconds on average, with an error rate below 1\%. The faster BCI used for stopping the wheelchair allowed a stop command to be issued within 5 seconds on average. Moreover, we investigated whether performance in the STOP interface would be affected during motion, and found no alteration relative to the static performance. Finally, the overall strategy was evaluated and compared to other brain controlled wheelchair projects. Despite the overhead required to select the destination on the interface, our wheelchair is faster than others (36\% faster than MAIA): thanks to the motion guidance strategy, the wheelchair always follows the shortest path and a greater speed is possible. Comparison was also performed using a cost function that takes into account traveling time and concentration effort; our strategy yields by far the smallest cost (the best other score is 72\% larger). This work resulted in a novel brain controlled wheelchair working prototype. It allows to navigate in a familiar indoor environment within a reasonable time. Emphasis was put on user's safety and comfort: the motion guidance strategy ensures smooth, safe and predictable navigation, while mental effort and fatigue are minimized by reducing control to destination selection.},

  abstract = {A brain-computer interface (BCI) is a communication system that can help users interact with the outside environment by translating brain signals into machine commands. The use of electroencephalographic (EEG) signals has become the most common approach for a BCI because of their usability and strong reliability. Many EEG-based BCI devices have been developed with traditional wet- or micro-electro-mechanical-system (MEMS)-type EEG sensors. However, those traditional sensors have uncomfortable disadvantage and require conductive gel and skin preparation on the part of the user. Therefore, acquiring the EEG signals in a comfortable and convenient manner is an important factor that should be incorporated into a novel BCI device. In the present study, a wearable, wireless and portable EEG-based BCI device with dry foam-based EEG sensors was developed and was demonstrated using a gaming control application. The dry EEG sensors operated without conductive gel; however, they were able to provide good conductivity and were able to acquire EEG signals effectively by adapting to irregular skin surfaces and by maintaining proper skin-sensor impedance on the forehead site. We have also demonstrated a real-time cognitive stage detection application of gaming control using the proposed portable device. The results of the present study indicate that using this portable EEG-based BCI device to conveniently and effectively control the outside world provides an approach for researching rehabilitation engineering.},

  abstract = {In their early days, brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) were only considered as control channel for end users with severe motor impairments such as people in the locked-in state. But, thanks to the multidisciplinary progress achieved over the last decade, the range of BCI applications has been substantially enlarged. Indeed, today BCI technology cannot only translate brain signals directly into control signals, but also can combine such kind of artificial output with a natural muscle-based output. Thus, the integration of multiple biological signals for real-time interaction holds the promise to enhance a much larger population than originally thought end users with preserved residual functions who could benefit from new generations of assistive technologies. A BCI system that combines a BCI with other physiological or technical signals is known as hybrid BCI (hBCI). In this work, we review the work of a large scale integrated project funded by the European commission which was dedicated to develop practical hybrid BCIs and introduce them in various fields of applications. This article presents an hBCI framework, which was used in studies with nonimpaired as well as end users with motor impairments.},

  abstract = {Although tDCS has been shown to improve motor learning, previous studies reported rather small effects. Since physiological effects of tDCS depend on intensity, the present study evaluated this parameter in order to enhance the effect of tDCS on skill acquisition. The effect of different stimulation intensities of anodal tDCS (atDCS) was investigated in a double blind, sham controlled crossover design. In each condition, thirteen healthy subjects were instructed to perform a unimanual motor (sequence) learning task. Our results showed (1) a significant increase in the slope of the learning curve and (2) a significant improvement in motor performance at retention for 1.5 mA atDCS as compared to sham tDCS. No significant differences were reported between 1 mA atDCS and sham tDCS; and between 1.5 mA atDCS and 1 mA atDCS.},

  doi = {10.1093/cercor/bht208},
  abstract = {Consolidation of motor skills after training can occur in a time- or sleep-dependent fashion. Recent studies revealed time-dependent consolidation as a common feature of visuomotor tasks. We have previously shown that anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in combination with repeated motor training benefits consolidation by the induction of offline skill gains in a complex visuomotor task, preventing the regular occurrence of skill loss between days. Here, we asked 2 questions: What is the time course of consolidation between days for this task and do exogenously induced offline gains develop as a function of time or overnight sleep? We found that both the development of offline skill loss in sham-stimulated subjects and offline skill gains induced by anodal tDCS critically depend on the passage of time after training, but not on overnight sleep. These findings support the view that tDCS interacts directly with the physiological consolidation process. However, in a control experiment, anodal tDCS applied after the training did not induce skill gains, implying that coapplication of tDCS and training is required to induce offline skill gains, pointing to the initiation of consolidation already during training.},

  abstract = {Recent studies have disclosed several oscillations occurring during resting sleep within the frequency range of the classical delta band (0.5\textendash{}4 Hz). There are at least 3 oscillations with distinct mechanisms and sites of origin: a slow (\&lt;1 Hz) cortically-generated oscillation, a clock-like thalamic oscillation (1\textendash{}4 Hz), and a cortical oscillation (1\textendash{}4 Hz). The present paper reviews data on these oscillations and the possible mechanisms which coalesce them into the polymorphic waves of slow wave sleep. Data stem from intracellular (over 500 single cell and 50 double impalements) and field potentials recorded from the cortex and thalamus of cats (120 animals) under ketamine and xylazine anesthesia. Other experiments were based on whole night EEG recordings from humans (5 subjects). The frequency of the slow oscillation both in anesthetized animals and in naturally sleeping humans ranged between 0.1 and 1 Hz (89\% of the cases being between 0.5 and 0.9 Hz). The slow (\&lt;1 Hz) oscillation is reflected in the EEG as rhythmic sequences of surface-negative waves (associated with hyperpolarizations of deeply-lying neurons) and surface-positive K-complexes (representing excitation in large pools of cortical neurons). Through its long-range synchronization, the slow oscillation has the ability to trigger and to group thalamically-generated spindles and two delta (1\textendash{}4 Hz) oscillations. Finally, it is argued that the analysis of the electroencephalogram should transcend the spectral analyses, by taking into account the shape of the waves and, when possible, the basic mechanisms that generate those waves.},

  abstract = {Research highlights that internal visual, external visual and kinesthetic imagery differentially effect motor performance (White \& Hardy, 1995; Hardy \& Callow, 1999). However, patterns of brain activation subserving these different imagery perspectives and modalities have not yet been established. In the current study, we applied the Vividness of Movement Imagery Questionnaire-2 (VMIQ-2) to study the brain activation underpinning these types of imagery. Participants with high imagery ability (using the VMIQ-2) were selected to participate in the study. The experimental conditions involved imagining an action (one item from the VMIQ-2) using internal visual imagery, external visual imagery, kinesthetic imagery and a perceptual control condition involved looking at a fixation cross. The imagery conditions were presented using a block design and the participants' brain activation was recorded using 3T fMRI. A post-experimental questionnaire was administered to test if participants were able to maintain the imagery during the task and if they switched between the imagery perspective/modalities. Four participants failed to adhere to the imagery conditions, and their data was excluded from analysis. As hypothesized, the different perspectives and modalities of imagery elicited both common areas of activation (in the right supplementary motor area, BA6) and dissociated areas of activation. Specifically, internal visual imagery activated occipital, parietal and frontal brain areas (i.e., the dorsal stream) while external visual imagery activated occipital ventral stream areas and kinesthetic imagery activated caudate and cerebellum areas. These results provide the first central evidence for the visual perspectives and modalities delineated in the VMIQ-2, and, initial biological validity for the VMIQ-2. However, given that only one item from the VMIQ-2 was employed, future fMRI research needs to explore all items to further examine these contentions.},

  abstract = {Rhythmic synchronization of neurons in the beta or gamma band occurs almost ubiquitously, and this synchronization has been linked to numerous nervous system functions. Many respective studies make the implicit assumption that neuronal synchronization affects neuronal interactions. Indeed, when neurons synchronize, their output spikes reach postsynaptic neurons together, trigger coincidence detection mechanisms, and therefore have an enhanced impact. There is ample experimental evidence demonstrating this consequence of neuronal synchronization, but beyond this, beta/gamma-band synchronization within a group of neurons might also modulate the impact of synaptic input to that synchronized group. This would constitute a separate mechanism through which synchronization affects neuronal interactions, but direct in vivo evidence for this putative mechanism is lacking. Here, we demonstrate that synchronized beta-band activity of a neuronal group modulates the efficacy of synaptic input to that group in-phase with the beta rhythm. This response modulation was not an addition of rhythmic activity onto the average response but a rhythmic modulation of multiplicative input gain. Our results demonstrate that beta-rhythmic activity of a neuronal target group multiplexes input gain along the rhythm cycle. The actual gain of an input then depends on the precision and the phase of its rhythmic synchronization to this target, providing one mechanistic explanation for why synchronization modulates interactions.},

  abstract = {The ability to hold multiple objects in memory is fundamental to intelligent behavior, but its neural basis remains poorly understood. It has been suggested that multiple items may be held in memory by oscillatory activity across neuronal populations, but yet there is little direct evidence. Here, we show that neuronal information about two objects held in short-term memory is enhanced at specific phases of underlying oscillatory population activity. We recorded neuronal activity from the prefrontal cortices of monkeys remembering two visual objects over a brief interval. We found that during this memory interval prefrontal population activity was rhythmically synchronized at frequencies around 32 and 3 Hz and that spikes carried the most information about the memorized objects at specific phases. Further, according to their order of presentation, optimal encoding of the first presented object was significantly earlier in the 32 Hz cycle than that for the second object. Our results suggest that oscillatory neuronal synchronization mediates a phase-dependent coding of memorized objects in the prefrontal cortex. Encoding at distinct phases may play a role for disambiguating information about multiple objects in short-term memory.},

  abstract = {Electrical recordings in humans and monkeys show attentional enhancement of evoked responses and gamma synchrony in ventral stream cortical areas. Does this synchrony result from intrinsic activity in visual cortex or from inputs from other structures? Using paired-recordings in the frontal eye field (FEF) and area V4, we found that attention to a stimulus in their joint receptive field leads to enhanced oscillatory coupling between the two areas, particularly at gamma frequencies. This coupling appeared to be initiated by FEF and was time-shifted by about 8-13 ms across a range of frequencies. Considering the expected conduction and synaptic delays between the areas, this time-shifted coupling at gamma frequencies may optimize the postsynaptic impact of spikes from one area upon the other, improving cross-area communication with attention.},

  abstract = {Episodic memory requires the hippocampus, which is thought to bind cortical inputs into conjunctive codes. Local field potentials (LFPs) reflect dendritic and synaptic oscillations whose temporal structure may coordinate cellular mechanisms of plasticity and memory. We now report that single-trial spatial memory performance in rats was predicted by the power comodulation of theta (4\textendash{}10 Hz) and low gamma (30\textendash{}50 Hz) rhythms in the hippocampus. Theta\textendash{}gamma comodulation (TGC) was prominent during successful memory retrieval but was weak when memory failed or was unavailable during spatial exploration in sample trials. Muscimol infusion into medial septum reduced the probability of TGC and successful memory retrieval. In contrast, patterned electrical stimulation of the fimbria-fornix increased TGC in amnestic animals and partially rescued memory performance in the water maze. The results suggest that TGC accompanies memory retrieval in the hippocampus and that patterned brain stimulation may inform therapeutic strategies for cognitive disorders.},
