  abstract = {Recurrent chromosomal alterations provide cytological and molecular positions for the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer. Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) has been useful in understanding these alterations in cancerous cells. CGH datasets consist of samples that are represented by large dimensional arrays of intervals. Each sample consists of long runs of intervals with losses and gains.
In this article, we develop novel SVM-based methods for classification and feature selection of CGH data. For classification, we developed a novel similarity kernel that is shown to be more effective than the standard linear kernel used in SVM. For feature selection, we propose a novel method based on the new kernel that iteratively selects features that provides the maximum benefit for classification. We compared our methods against the best wrapper-based and filter-based approaches that have been used for feature selection of large dimensional biological data. Our results on datasets generated from the Progenetix database, suggests that our methods are considerably superior to existing methods.

  abstract = {In this paper we investigate the use of the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) as a performance measure for machine learning algorithms. As a case study we evaluate six machine learning algorithms (C4.5, Multiscale Classifier, Perceptron, Multi-layer Perceptron, k-Nearest Neighbours, and a Quadratic Discriminant Function) on six ``real world'' medical diagnostics data sets. We compare and discuss the use of AUC to the more conventional overall accuracy and find that AUC exhibits a number of desirable properties when compared to overall accuracy: increased sensitivity in Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) tests; a standard error that decreased as both AUC and the number of test samples increased; decision threshold independent; and it is invariant to a priori class probabilities. The paper concludes with the recommendation that AUC be used in preference to overall accuracy for ``single number'' evaluation of machine learning algorithms.},

  abstract = {Electrocorticography of the primary motor cortex (M1) is a promising tool for controlling a brain\textendash{}computer interface (BCI). Electrocorticograms (ECoG) of the human M1 within the central sulcus (intrasulcal ECoG) have been rarely examined. In order to evaluate the usefulness of intrasulcal ECoG for BCI, we examined patients with subdural electrodes placed temporarily inside the central sulcus and over the sensorimotor cortex (gyral ECoG). Five patients were asked to perform or imagine two or three classes of simple upper limb movements. Univariate statistical analysis of the results revealed that the intrasulcal ECoG on M1 showed significant variability across movement classes. A support vector machine was used for classification of single-trial ECoG signals to infer movement class (neural decoding). The movement classes were predicted with 80\textendash{}90\% accuracy (chance level: 33\% or 50\%). To reveal the relative importance of anatomical areas for neural decoding, the decoding performance was compared between gyral and intrasulcal ECoGs. The intrasulcal ECoG on the motor bank showed higher performance than the equally-sized gyral ECoG or the intrasulcal ECoG on the sensory bank. Analysis using a short time window revealed that movement class could be decoded even before movement onset. These results suggest the usefulness of intrasulcal ECoG on M1 to infer upper limb movements and present a promising application for a practical BCI system.},

This is done by defining a purely invertible discrete transform, representing a signal either in the time or in the time-frequency domain, as simply as possible with the conventional discrete Fourier transform between the time and the frequency domains. The wavelet concept has been used to build this transform. To get a correct invertibility of this procedure, the authors have proposed orthogonal and periodic basic discrete wavelets. The properties of such a transform are described, and examples on brain-evoked potential signals are given to illustrate the time-frequency filtering possibilities.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.neuroimage.2011.06.084},
  abstract = {Electrocorticographic (ECoG) signals have been successfully used to provide information about arm movement direction, individual finger movements and even continuous arm movement trajectories. Thus, ECoG has been proposed as a potential control signal for implantable brain\textendash{}machine interfaces (BMIs) in paralyzed patients. For the neuronal control of a prosthesis with versatile hand/arm functions, it is also necessary to successfully decode different types of grasping movements, such as precision grip and whole-hand grip. Although grasping is one of the most frequent and important hand movements performed in everyday life, until now, the decoding of ECoG activity related to different grasp types has not been systematically investigated. Here, we show that two different grasp types (precision vs. whole-hand grip) can be reliably distinguished in natural reach-to-grasp movements in single-trial ECoG recordings from the human motor cortex. Self-paced movement execution in a paradigm accounting for variability in grasped object position and weight was chosen to create a situation similar to everyday settings. We identified three informative signal components (low-pass-filtered component, low-frequency and high-frequency amplitude modulations), which allowed for accurate decoding of precision and whole-hand grips. Importantly, grasp type decoding generalized over different object positions and weights. Within the frontal lobe, informative signals predominated in the precentral motor cortex and could also be found in the right hemisphere's homologue of Broca's area. We conclude that ECoG signals are promising candidates for BMIs that include the restoration of grasping movements. Highlights \ensuremath{\blackpointerright} Two modes of natural grasping can be reliably discriminated from human ECoG. \ensuremath{\blackpointerright} The decoding of grasp types generalizes over different object positions and weights. \ensuremath{\blackpointerright} A low-frequency component and high-frequency amplitudes yield best decoding. \ensuremath{\blackpointerright} ECoG may be used in BMIs for the restoration of grasping movements.},

Here, we aim to bridge this gap by focusing on up-to-date recording techniques for measurement of HFO and new analysis tools for their quantitative assessment. In particular, we emphasize how these methods can be applied, what property might be inferred from neuronal signals, and potentially productive future directions.},

However, the dynamics of the underlying neurophysiological processes remain unclear. In particular, whether AI is on the receiving or driving end of the error-monitoring network is unresolved. Here, we recorded intracerebral electroencephalography signals simultaneously from AI and dmPFC in epileptic patients while they performed a stop-signal task. We found that errors selectively modulated broadband neural activity in human AI. Granger causality estimates revealed that errors were immediately followed by a feedforward influence from AI onto anterior cingulate cortex and, subsequently, onto presupplementary motor area. The reverse pattern of information flow was observed on correct responses. Our findings provide the first direct electrophysiological evidence indicating that the anterior insula rapidly detects and conveys error signals to dmPFC, while the latter might use this input to adapt behavior following inappropriate actions.},

  abstract = {Background
Sleep staging is a critical step in a range of electrophysiological signal processing pipelines used in clinical routine as well as in sleep research. Although the results currently achievable with automatic sleep staging methods are promising, there is need for improvement, especially given the time-consuming and tedious nature of visual sleep scoring.
New method
Here we propose a sleep staging framework that consists of a multi-class support vector machine (SVM) classification based on a decision tree approach. The performance of the method was evaluated using polysomnographic data from 15 subjects (electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculogram (EOG) and electromyogram (EMG) recordings). The decision tree, or dendrogram, was obtained using a hierarchical clustering technique and a wide range of time and frequency-domain features were extracted. Feature selection was carried out using forward sequential selection and classification was evaluated using k-fold cross-validation.
Results
The dendrogram-based SVM (DSVM) achieved mean specificity, sensitivity and overall accuracy of 0.92, 0.74 and 0.88 respectively, compared to expert visual scoring. Restricting DSVM classification to data where both experts' scoring was consistent (76.73\% of the data) led to a mean specificity, sensitivity and overall accuracy of 0.94, 0.82 and 0.92 respectively.
Comparison with existing methods
The DSVM framework outperforms classification with more standard multi-class ``one-against-all'' SVM and linear-discriminant analysis.
Conclusion
The promising results of the proposed methodology suggest that it may be a valuable alternative to existing automatic methods and that it could accelerate visual scoring by providing a robust starting hypnogram that can be further fine-tuned by expert inspection.},

@phdthesis{rebsamen_brain_2009,
  title = {A {{Brain Controlled Wheelchair}} to {{Navigate}} in {{Familiar Environments}}},
  abstract = {The Brain Controlled Wheelchair (BCW) is a simple robotic system designed for people, such as locked-in people, who are not able to use physical interfaces like joysticks or buttons. Our goal is to develop a system usable in hospitals and homes with minimal infrastructure modifications, which can help these people regain some mobility. The main challenge is to provide continuous and precise 2D control of the wheelchair from a Brain Computer Interface, which is typically characterized by a a very low information transfer rate. Besides, as design constraints, we want our BCW to be safe, ergonomic and relatively low cost. The strategy we propose relies on 1) constraining the motion of the wheelchair along predefined guiding paths, and 2) a slow but accurate P300 EEG brain interface to select the destination in a menu. This strategy reduces control to the selection of the appropriate destination, thus requires little concentration effort from the user. Besides, the trajectory is predictable, which contributes to reduce stress, and eliminates frustration that may be associated with trajectories generated by an artificial agent. Two fast BCIs are proposed to allow stopping the wheelchair while in motion. A hybrid BCI was developed to combine the slow P300 BCI used for destination selection with a faster modality to stop the wheelchair while in motion. Experiments with healthy users were conducted to evaluate performances of the BCIs. We found that after a short calibration phase, the destination selection BCI allowed the choice of a destination within 15 seconds on average, with an error rate below 1\%. The faster BCI used for stopping the wheelchair allowed a stop command to be issued within 5 seconds on average. Moreover, we investigated whether performance in the STOP interface would be affected during motion, and found no alteration relative to the static performance. Finally, the overall strategy was evaluated and compared to other brain controlled wheelchair projects. Despite the overhead required to select the destination on the interface, our wheelchair is faster than others (36\% faster than MAIA): thanks to the motion guidance strategy, the wheelchair always follows the shortest path and a greater speed is possible. Comparison was also performed using a cost function that takes into account traveling time and concentration effort; our strategy yields by far the smallest cost (the best other score is 72\% larger). This work resulted in a novel brain controlled wheelchair working prototype. It allows to navigate in a familiar indoor environment within a reasonable time. Emphasis was put on user's safety and comfort: the motion guidance strategy ensures smooth, safe and predictable navigation, while mental effort and fatigue are minimized by reducing control to destination selection.},

  abstract = {A brain-computer interface (BCI) is a communication system that can help users interact with the outside environment by translating brain signals into machine commands. The use of electroencephalographic (EEG) signals has become the most common approach for a BCI because of their usability and strong reliability. Many EEG-based BCI devices have been developed with traditional wet- or micro-electro-mechanical-system (MEMS)-type EEG sensors. However, those traditional sensors have uncomfortable disadvantage and require conductive gel and skin preparation on the part of the user. Therefore, acquiring the EEG signals in a comfortable and convenient manner is an important factor that should be incorporated into a novel BCI device. In the present study, a wearable, wireless and portable EEG-based BCI device with dry foam-based EEG sensors was developed and was demonstrated using a gaming control application. The dry EEG sensors operated without conductive gel; however, they were able to provide good conductivity and were able to acquire EEG signals effectively by adapting to irregular skin surfaces and by maintaining proper skin-sensor impedance on the forehead site. We have also demonstrated a real-time cognitive stage detection application of gaming control using the proposed portable device. The results of the present study indicate that using this portable EEG-based BCI device to conveniently and effectively control the outside world provides an approach for researching rehabilitation engineering.},

  abstract = {In their early days, brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) were only considered as control channel for end users with severe motor impairments such as people in the locked-in state. But, thanks to the multidisciplinary progress achieved over the last decade, the range of BCI applications has been substantially enlarged. Indeed, today BCI technology cannot only translate brain signals directly into control signals, but also can combine such kind of artificial output with a natural muscle-based output. Thus, the integration of multiple biological signals for real-time interaction holds the promise to enhance a much larger population than originally thought end users with preserved residual functions who could benefit from new generations of assistive technologies. A BCI system that combines a BCI with other physiological or technical signals is known as hybrid BCI (hBCI). In this work, we review the work of a large scale integrated project funded by the European commission which was dedicated to develop practical hybrid BCIs and introduce them in various fields of applications. This article presents an hBCI framework, which was used in studies with nonimpaired as well as end users with motor impairments.},

Since physiological effects of tDCS depend on intensity, the present study evaluated this parameter in order to enhance the effect of tDCS on skill acquisition. The effect of different stimulation intensities of anodal tDCS (atDCS) was investigated in a double blind, sham controlled crossover design. In each condition, thirteen healthy subjects were instructed to perform a unimanual motor (sequence) learning task. Our results showed (1) a significant increase in the slope of the learning curve and (2) a significant improvement in motor performance at retention for 1.5 mA atDCS as compared to sham tDCS. No significant differences were reported between 1 mA atDCS and sham tDCS; and between 1.5 mA atDCS and 1 mA atDCS.},

  abstract = {Consolidation of motor skills after training can occur in a time- or sleep-dependent fashion. Recent studies revealed time-dependent consolidation as a common feature of visuomotor tasks. We have previously shown that anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in combination with repeated motor training benefits consolidation by the induction of offline skill gains in a complex visuomotor task, preventing the regular occurrence of skill loss between days. Here, we asked 2 questions: What is the time course of consolidation between days for this task and do exogenously induced offline gains develop as a function of time or overnight sleep? We found that both the development of offline skill loss in sham-stimulated subjects and offline skill gains induced by anodal tDCS critically depend on the passage of time after training, but not on overnight sleep. These findings support the view that tDCS interacts directly with the physiological consolidation process. However, in a control experiment, anodal tDCS applied after the training did not induce skill gains, implying that coapplication of tDCS and training is required to induce offline skill gains, pointing to the initiation of consolidation already during training.},
