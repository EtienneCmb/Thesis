  abstract = {Recurrent chromosomal alterations provide cytological and molecular positions for the diagnosis and prognosis of cancer. Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) has been useful in understanding these alterations in cancerous cells. CGH datasets consist of samples that are represented by large dimensional arrays of intervals. Each sample consists of long runs of intervals with losses and gains.
In this article, we develop novel SVM-based methods for classification and feature selection of CGH data. For classification, we developed a novel similarity kernel that is shown to be more effective than the standard linear kernel used in SVM. For feature selection, we propose a novel method based on the new kernel that iteratively selects features that provides the maximum benefit for classification. We compared our methods against the best wrapper-based and filter-based approaches that have been used for feature selection of large dimensional biological data. Our results on datasets generated from the Progenetix database, suggests that our methods are considerably superior to existing methods.

  abstract = {In this paper we investigate the use of the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) as a performance measure for machine learning algorithms. As a case study we evaluate six machine learning algorithms (C4.5, Multiscale Classifier, Perceptron, Multi-layer Perceptron, k-Nearest Neighbours, and a Quadratic Discriminant Function) on six ``real world'' medical diagnostics data sets. We compare and discuss the use of AUC to the more conventional overall accuracy and find that AUC exhibits a number of desirable properties when compared to overall accuracy: increased sensitivity in Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) tests; a standard error that decreased as both AUC and the number of test samples increased; decision threshold independent; and it is invariant to a priori class probabilities. The paper concludes with the recommendation that AUC be used in preference to overall accuracy for ``single number'' evaluation of machine learning algorithms.},

  abstract = {Electrocorticography of the primary motor cortex (M1) is a promising tool for controlling a brain\textendash{}computer interface (BCI). Electrocorticograms (ECoG) of the human M1 within the central sulcus (intrasulcal ECoG) have been rarely examined. In order to evaluate the usefulness of intrasulcal ECoG for BCI, we examined patients with subdural electrodes placed temporarily inside the central sulcus and over the sensorimotor cortex (gyral ECoG). Five patients were asked to perform or imagine two or three classes of simple upper limb movements. Univariate statistical analysis of the results revealed that the intrasulcal ECoG on M1 showed significant variability across movement classes. A support vector machine was used for classification of single-trial ECoG signals to infer movement class (neural decoding). The movement classes were predicted with 80\textendash{}90\% accuracy (chance level: 33\% or 50\%). To reveal the relative importance of anatomical areas for neural decoding, the decoding performance was compared between gyral and intrasulcal ECoGs. The intrasulcal ECoG on the motor bank showed higher performance than the equally-sized gyral ECoG or the intrasulcal ECoG on the sensory bank. Analysis using a short time window revealed that movement class could be decoded even before movement onset. These results suggest the usefulness of intrasulcal ECoG on M1 to infer upper limb movements and present a promising application for a practical BCI system.},

This is done by defining a purely invertible discrete transform, representing a signal either in the time or in the time-frequency domain, as simply as possible with the conventional discrete Fourier transform between the time and the frequency domains. The wavelet concept has been used to build this transform. To get a correct invertibility of this procedure, the authors have proposed orthogonal and periodic basic discrete wavelets. The properties of such a transform are described, and examples on brain-evoked potential signals are given to illustrate the time-frequency filtering possibilities.},

However, because of the deluge of multichannel data generated by these experiments, achieving the full potential of parallel neuronal recordings depends on the development of new data mining techniques to extract meaningful information relating to time, frequency and space. Here, we aim to bridge this gap by focusing on up-to-date recording techniques for measurement of HFO and new analysis tools for their quantitative assessment. In particular, we emphasize how these methods can be applied, what property might be inferred from neuronal signals, and potentially productive future directions.},

  shorttitle = {Learning machines and sleeping brains},
  doi = {10.1016/j.jneumeth.2015.01.022},
  abstract = {Background
Sleep staging is a critical step in a range of electrophysiological signal processing pipelines used in clinical routine as well as in sleep research. Although the results currently achievable with automatic sleep staging methods are promising, there is need for improvement, especially given the time-consuming and tedious nature of visual sleep scoring.
New method
Here we propose a sleep staging framework that consists of a multi-class support vector machine (SVM) classification based on a decision tree approach. The performance of the method was evaluated using polysomnographic data from 15 subjects (electroencephalogram (EEG), electrooculogram (EOG) and electromyogram (EMG) recordings). The decision tree, or dendrogram, was obtained using a hierarchical clustering technique and a wide range of time and frequency-domain features were extracted. Feature selection was carried out using forward sequential selection and classification was evaluated using k-fold cross-validation.
Results
The dendrogram-based SVM (DSVM) achieved mean specificity, sensitivity and overall accuracy of 0.92, 0.74 and 0.88 respectively, compared to expert visual scoring. Restricting DSVM classification to data where both experts' scoring was consistent (76.73\% of the data) led to a mean specificity, sensitivity and overall accuracy of 0.94, 0.82 and 0.92 respectively.
Comparison with existing methods
The DSVM framework outperforms classification with more standard multi-class ``one-against-all'' SVM and linear-discriminant analysis.
Conclusion
The promising results of the proposed methodology suggest that it may be a valuable alternative to existing automatic methods and that it could accelerate visual scoring by providing a robust starting hypnogram that can be further fine-tuned by expert inspection.},
